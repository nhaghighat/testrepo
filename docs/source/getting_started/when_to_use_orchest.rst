When to use Orchest
===================

If you haven't set up a bespoke infrastructure for your data pipelines yet, then Orchest is a great
way to start. Using Orchest you don't have to manage any of this infrastructure yourself and you can
get started building your data pipelines right away. You can even get started by creating a pipeline
from an existing :ref:`project <projects>`, just assign your existing files to steps and connect
them to form a :ref:`pipeline <pipelines>`. With just a few connections your pipeline is ready to be
productionized using :ref:`jobs <jobs>`.

Who would benefit from using Orchest?
-------------------------------------
To list a few:

* Small data teams who are tasked with a broad range of responsibilities, ranging from data
  engineering to model building and analytics.
* Data scientists and engineers who like the interactive style of working of Notebooks. You can
  totally use scripts exclusively as well.
* Anyone who is looking to create pipelines through a visual interface instead of YAML.
