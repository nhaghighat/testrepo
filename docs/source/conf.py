# -- Path setup -------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another
# directory, add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory
# is relative to the documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it
# absolute, like shown here.

# -- Project information ----------------------------------------------

# We exclude the exact release because that is error prone when having
# to update it on every release.
# release = "0.3.0"
version = "alpha"

# -- General configuration --------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# here, relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin
# static files, so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the
# builtin "default.css".
