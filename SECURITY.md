# Security policy

## Supported versions

Currently we do not offer security patches for issues only present in older Orchest versions.
Generally speaking, we provide security updates by releasing a new Orchest version. Upon discovering
a security issue, we will release a security advisory.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities by emailing us at `rick@orchest.io` or `yannick@orchest.io`.
Alternatively, you can send us a DM (so that it is private) through our [slack community
channel](https://join.slack.com/t/orchest/shared_invite/zt-g6wooj3r-6XI8TCWJrXvUnXKdIKU_8w).
Thank you!
