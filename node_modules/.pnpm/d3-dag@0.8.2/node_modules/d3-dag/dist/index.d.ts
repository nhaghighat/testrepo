/**
 * This file contains all of the exports that make it into the pure javascript
 * / bundled flat structure.
 *
 * To create a dag structure from data, a necessary first step before computing
 * a layout, see the three creation algorithms:
 * - {@link HierarchyOperator} - when the data already has a dag structure.
 * - {@link StratifyOperator} - when the dag has a tabular structure, referencing parents by id.
 * - {@link ConnectOperator} - when the dag has a link structure and is specified as pairs of nodes.
 *
 * To layout a dag see the two dag layout algorithms:
 * - {@link SugiyamaOperator} - for a general layered dag representation
 * - {@link ZherebkoOperator} - for a simple topological layout
