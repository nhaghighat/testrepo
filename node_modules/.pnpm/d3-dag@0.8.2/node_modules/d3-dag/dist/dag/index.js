/**
 * A {@link Dag} is simply a collection of {@link DagNode}s, defined by every reachable
 * child node from the current returned node.  If a DAG contains multiple
 * roots, then the returned object will not have accessable children or data,
 * e.g. it will be a {@link Dag} but not a {@link DagNode}. It will still
 * support gettings the roots or iteration over all nodes.
 *
 * There are three built-in methods for creating dags from data:
 * {@link HierarchyOperator}, {@link StratifyOperator}, and
 * {@link ConnectOperator}.
