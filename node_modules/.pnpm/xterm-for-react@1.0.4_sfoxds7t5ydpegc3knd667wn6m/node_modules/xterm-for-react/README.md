# XTerm For React

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xterm-for-react.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xterm-for-react)

XTerm For React is a React wrapper made for XTerm.js to allow you to easly integrate XTerm into any React project.

# Getting Started

## Installation

You can install XTerm For React using the following commands:

NPM:

```
npm install xterm-for-react
```

Yarn:

```
yarn add xterm-for-react
```

## Running The Examples
- Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/robert-harbison/xterm-for-react.git```.
- Open terminal and ```cd``` to the example directory in the repo you just cloned.
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```npm start``` to start the example.

## Basic Terminal

The main component to this library is 'XTerm'. This will create a div and use it to open a XTerm.js terminal. The base terminal won't really do anything as it is just the terminal UI.

You can create the base terminal using:

```
// Import XTerm
import { XTerm } from 'xterm-for-react'

// Render the component
<XTerm />
```

## 'XTerm' Props

\*\* Some of theme types are included with XTerm.js not with xterm-for-react

\*\* Any 'Prop' with a '?' is optional.

## Calling XTerm Functions

If we don't have a wrapper for a specific method in XTerm.js you can call any function in XTerm.js using a ref. [You can look here for the functions provided by XTerm.js](https://xtermjs.org/docs/)

(There will soon wrapper functions for XTerm.js functions but right now you will need to use a ref.)

```jsx
    import * as React from 'react'

    export const Terminal = () => {
        const xtermRef = React.useRef(null)

        React.useEffect(() => {
            // You can call any method in XTerm.js by using 'xterm xtermRef.current.terminal.[What you want to call]
            xtermRef.current.terminal.writeln("Hello, World!")
        }, [])

        return (
            // Create a new terminal and set it's ref.
            <XTerm ref={xtermRef} />
        )
    }
```

## Terminal Options

You can pass options that you want to use to instantiate the XTerm.js 'Terminal' with as a prop tot he XTerm component. [Here](https://xtermjs.org/docs/api/terminal/interfaces/iterminaloptions/) is a link to the terminal options documentation.

```
    // Import XTerm
    import { XTerm } from 'xterm-for-react'

    // Render the component
    <XTerm options={{ lineHeight: 3 }} />
```

## Addons

You can use XTerm.js addons by using the `addons` prop. This prop is an array of addons you want to load.

You can see an example of using addons please see [this](https://github.com/robert-harbison/xterm-for-react/blob/master/example/src/examples/Addons.js) file in the example folder.

```
    // Import the addon
    import { SearchAddon } from 'xterm-addon-search'

    // Instantiate the addon
    const searchAddon = new SearchAddon()

    // Load the addons as a prop
    <XTerm addons={[searchAddon]} />
```
