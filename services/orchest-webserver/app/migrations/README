Generic single-database configuration.

Note that `env.py`, `alembic.ini`, `script.py.mako` were automatically
generated by `flask-migrate`. The `revisions` directory contains
revision files that were generated by `flask-migrate` but that we "own",
and are in charge of checking for correctness.  
These files are required by `flask-migrate` to work.
